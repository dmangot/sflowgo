sflowgo
=======

Store sflow data in MongoDB.   Use it to get your top URLs or Memcache keys.   There are currently no Open Source tools that do this yet AFAIK, so I decided to start writing one.

I recommend using the latest dev branch of Mongo because I think the new aggregation framework would be a good fit for counting.

This is just some code I've been playing around with as I practice Ruby and learn about MongoDB.
Comments/suggestions/contributions are surely welcome.
